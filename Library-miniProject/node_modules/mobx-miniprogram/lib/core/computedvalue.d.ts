/**
 * A node in the state dependency root that observes other nodes, and can be observed itself.
 *
 * ComputedValue will remember the result of the computation for the duration of the batch, or
 * while being observed.
 *
 * During this time it will recompute only when one of its direct dependencies changed,
 * but only when it is being accessed with `ComputedValue.get()`.
 *
 * Implementation description:
 * 1. First time it's being accessed it will compute and remember result
 *    give back remembered result until 2. happens
 * 2. First time any deep dependency change, propagate POSSIBLY_STALE to all observers, wait for 3.
 * 3. When it's being accessed, recompute if any shallow dependency changed.
 *    if result changed: propagate STALE to all observers, that were POSSIBLY_STALE from the last step.
 *    go to step 2. either way
 *
 * If at any point it's outside batch and it isn't observed: reset everything and go to 1.
